Configuring Protoc Compiler Settings

1. Open IDEA's compiler preferences and navigate to the Protocol Buffers compiler settings:
   File->Settings->Compiler(Project Settings)->Protocol Buffers compiler
2. Click the widget to the right of the "Path to Protoc" text field to open a file chooser.  Navigate to the location
   where you have installed the Google Protocol buffers compiler executable, protoc, and select the protoc file.  Click the 'OK' button to close the file chooser.
3. Close the preferences.

Configuring Facet Settings

1. Open the project structure panel.
2. Click on the 'Modules' entry in the list of 'Project Settings'.
3. Create a facet for each module for which you want to generate Java source files from your .proto files:
       a) Right click on a module, and choose 'Protobuf Facet' from submenu of the 'New' menu entry of the contextual
       menu.
       b) On the facet configuration screen, set the "Output source directory" to the directory where you wish to
          generate the Java files corresponding to your .proto files for that module.
          NOTE: The directory you choose for the "Output source directory" should also be configured as a source
                directory for the module.  Please refer to IDEA's help files if you need assistance to do so.


After configuring the Protobuf compiler and desired facets, compiling a project or a module that is configured with a
Protobuf Facet will result in Java source files being generated from the .proto files in the affected modules.

Enjoy!
